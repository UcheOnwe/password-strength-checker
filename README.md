# Password Strength Checker

A beginner-friendly Python program that checks the strength of a user's password based on these rules:

- Minimum 8 characters
- At least 1 number
- At least 1 uppercase letter
- At least 1 lowercase letter
- At least 1 special character

## How It Works

The program uses regular expressions to search for different elements inside the password and returns either:

- ✅ "Strong password"
- ⚠️ "Weak password — try adding numbers, caps, symbols, and at least 8 characters."

## How to Run It

1. Open `main.py`
2. Run the file in a terminal
3. Enter a password when prompted
4. See your result instantly
